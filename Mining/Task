Task:

One of the core requirements of our data science team, is to be able to draw insights from data and data analysis. With this in mind, have a play with the data and draw an insight. To support this insight, 1-2 graphics should be provided to show to the interviewing team.
- By 2 graphics we mean 2 graphs, not 2 pages of a dashboard filled with graphs… No more than 2 graphics will be looked at during the interview.
- Feedback from previous years is that one clear concise insight backed up by a clear graph will put you above many insights represented on many pages.

During the interview – you’ll be asked to present your insight while we look at the graphics on our end. The graphics must be emailed the day ahead of the interview – to allow for a back and forth if there are issues opening it on our side.

It’s viewed that you should only take 1-2 hours to complete this – please don’t spend days on it. It’s about the value of the insight that is given rather than the prettiest graphic or the most complex analysis. It’s only a few hours – so it’s not expected that the insight will be groundbreaking. It’s about identifying an insight which has value to the business, providing a graphic to show it and presenting it back (a few minutes) in the interview.
