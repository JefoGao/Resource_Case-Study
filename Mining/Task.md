## About the data

The data has been made up but is similar to the type of data you could work with in the Digital & Platform Vacation Student role.

The data represents results from a fictional processing plant and some basic definitions are provided below. The definitions are to provide context only, no calculations are required for the analysis. A schematic is provided in Figure 1.

- Head Grade – the amount of valuable metal contained in the feed to the processing plant.
  - For example 0.2% Cu means in 1 tonne (t) of ore fed to the processing plant there is $\frac{0.2}{100}\times 1 = 0.002$ tonnes of copper (Cu) in the feed
  - For example 0.8g/t (grams per tonne) Au means in 1 tonne of ore fed to the processing plant there is 0.8 grams of gold (Au).
  - For example 1% S in 5000 tonnes of ore fed to the processing plant there is $\frac{1}{100}\times 5000 = 50$ tonnes of sulphur (S) in the feed
- Concentrate tonnes – the amount of saleable product produced by the processing plant
- Concentrate grade – the amount of valuable metal contained in the concentrate produced by the plant (similar to head grade)
  - For example 13% Cu means in 250t of concentrate produced means there is $\frac{13}{100}\times 250 = 32.5$ tonnes of copper in concentrate
  - For example 80g/t Au means in 250 tonne of concentrate produced there is $80\times 250 = 20,000$ grams of gold in concentrate (this is about 643 troy ounces)
- Tail grade – "Tail" or "Tailings" is the waste stream from the processing plant. Tail grade is the amount of valuable metal contained in the tail stream.
- Recovery – represents the ratio of the mass of metal recovered to concentrate to the mass of metal that was in the feed. It is usually expressed as a percentage.
  - For example: $\frac{20000}{25000}\times 100% = 80%$ Au Recovery, where 20000 is 20000g Au in concertate, 25000 is 25000g Au in plant feed.
  - For example: $\frac{13%\times 250}{0.1%\times 40000}× 100% = 81.25%$ Cu Recovery, where numerator is 13% Cu times 250t concentrate, denominator is 0.1% Cu times 40000t plant feed.

## Task

One of the core requirements of our data science team, is to be able to draw insights from data and data analysis. With this in mind, have a play with the data and draw an insight. To support this insight, 1-2 graphics should be provided to show to the interviewing team.
- By 2 graphics we mean 2 graphs, not 2 pages of a dashboard filled with graphs… No more than 2 graphics will be looked at during the interview.
- Feedback from previous years is that one clear concise insight backed up by a clear graph will put you above many insights represented on many pages.

During the interview – you’ll be asked to present your insight while we look at the graphics on our end. The graphics must be emailed the day ahead of the interview – to allow for a back and forth if there are issues opening it on our side.

It’s viewed that you should only take 1-2 hours to complete this – please don’t spend days on it. It’s about the value of the insight that is given rather than the prettiest graphic or the most complex analysis. It’s only a few hours – so it’s not expected that the insight will be groundbreaking. It’s about identifying an insight which has value to the business, providing a graphic to show it and presenting it back (a few minutes) in the interview.
